# Tower Locator App

## Overview

The Tower Locator App is a Swift-based application that helps you locate cell towers using a map interface. You can either manually create a location dot on the map or input the coordinates of the tower. The app provides two main navigation modes:

1. **Compass Mode**: Use the built-in compass at the bottom of the screen to navigate towards the tower.
2. **AR Mode**: Use the device’s camera and augmented reality (AR) to align with the correct compass bearing and head towards the tower.

Additionally, the app allows you to input the tower's location, which you retrieve from the RFNSA website. It’s an efficient tool for anyone working with tower locations and communications infrastructure.
